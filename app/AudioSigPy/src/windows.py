    Generate a Triangle window, or 2nd-order B-spline window.
    
    Theory:
        The Triangular window, also known as the Bartlett or Fej√©r window, is a 2nd-order B-spline window function that is 
        particularly useful in signal processing for smoothing and reducing spectral leakage. It achieves this by 
        convolving two rectangular windows of half-width, resulting in a piecewise linear function that tapers the signal's 
        edges to zero. This window is beneficial for its simplicity and effectiveness in various applications, especially 
        when a balance between main lobe width and side lobe levels is desired. The triangular window was developed to

    Theory:
        The cosine-sum windows, also known as generalized cosine windows, are mathematical functions used in signal 
        processing to mitigate the discontinuities at the boundaries of a signal segment. This window function is expressed 
        as a sum of cosine terms, each scaled by a coefficient, where the coefficients are usually non-negative. The 
        primary utility of the cosine-sum window lies in its ability to reduce spectral leakage, thereby improving the

        well-known Hamming and Hann windows, which are specific instances characterized by particular sets of coefficients. 
        The development of these windows dates back to early work in digital signal processing, attributed to the

    Generate a Gaussian window.
    
    Theory:
        The Gaussian window function, also known as the Gaussian taper or Gaussian bell, is a windowing function used in 
        signal processing to minimize spectral leakage. It applies a Gaussian curve to the signal, effectively smoothing 
        the edges by reducing the amplitude at the ends of the window. This window is particularly useful because its 
        Fourier transform is also a Gaussian, making it ideal for applications requiring precise frequency estimation and 
        spectral analysis. A special case of the Gaussian window is when the standard deviation parameter, sigma, is set to 
        0.5, which provides an optimal balance between time and frequency resolution. The Gaussian window function was 
        developed by mathematicians and engineers in the mid-20th century to address the need for more accurate spectral 
        analysis tools. Its unique properties have made it a staple in both theoretical and practical signal processing.

    Math:
        The Gaussian window is defined as:
            w(n) = exp(-((x + N / 2) / (s * sqrt(2) * N / 2)) ^ 2),     0 <= n <= N

        signal in a way that provides the smallest possible frequency spread, enhancing time-frequency analysis. This 
        window includes the sine window and the Gaussian window as special cases, corresponding to large and small temporal 
        widths, respectively. Developed through advancements in signal processing, it is valued for its precision in

    Theory:
        The Poisson window, also known as the exponential window, is a window function that increases exponentially towards 
        its center and decreases exponentially towards its edges. This window function shapes the signal by applying an 
        exponential weighting, which helps reduce spectral leakage, making it useful in signal processing tasks such as 
        spectral analysis and filtering. A notable characteristic of the Poisson window is its non-zero values at the 
        boundaries, unlike other window functions that typically approach zero. It is believed to have been developed to 
        address the limitations of traditional window functions, providing a balance between frequency resolution and 
        side-lobe attenuation. The exponential window's unique properties make it especially effective in applications 
        requiring precise control over signal decay and window shape.

    Math:
        The Exponential window is defined as:

        is useful for reducing spectral leakage in signal processing, as it smooths the discontinuities at the edges of the 
        signal. The Tukey window transitions smoothly between a rectangular window (when a = 0) and a Hann window (when a = 
        1), making it adaptable for various applications. Developed by John Tukey in the mid-20th century, this window 
        function was created to provide a flexible tool for analyzing signals with varying characteristics. Its ability to
